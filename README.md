# Predicting-COVID19-Hospitalization
## Introduction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict if a COVID-19 patient requires hospitalization based on their symptoms and medical history. The goal is to assist healthcare workers in efficiently allocating resources to patients who need immediate medical attention during the ongoing pandemic.

## Data Description
A COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, containing anonymized patient information, is utilized. It is narrowed down to 15 relevant predictors, and observations are reduced to 5,000 for practicality.

## Model Building
The data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed for classification. Evaluation metrics include ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Conclusion
This project aims to aid healthcare providers in identifying patients requiring hospitalization. The random forest model shows promise in predicting hospitalization needs, potentially easing the strain on healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
